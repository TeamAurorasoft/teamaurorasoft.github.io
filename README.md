# Welcome to Aurorasoft
## About Us
Aurorasoft was created in early 2024 by a group of friends who wish to remain anonymous. They work together to create awesome web apps that are more often than not open-source. Aurorasoft believes in a free world wide web, which is why we will never charge for people to use our projects.
## Contact Us
You can contact our team at our [email](mailto:team.aurorasoft@gmail.com) or by leaving an issue on one of our repositories. We will make a website in the future with a contact form.
